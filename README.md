# Secret-Santa
Secret Santa Code &amp; Email send out in Python!

Takes a list of email addresses on a text file, 

Allocates everybody another person (not themselves)

This then sends via email to everybody, with the name of who they got.


Slight tweaks will be needed depending on:

Email domain (I am using outlook 365) - this is because will require different server connection

The format of emails - mine is FirstName.Surname@domain.com

Perfect for Christmas time for friends or colleagues. It's a fun way to allocate.

Let me know if you have any questions :)
